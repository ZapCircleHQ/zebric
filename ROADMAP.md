# Zebric Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development of Zebric as a runtime platform for AI-generated applications and rapid prototyping.

## Vision

Zebric serves as a **solid foundation for AI code generation tools** by providing:
- **Token-efficient output**: Declarative Blueprints instead of thousands of lines of generated code
- **Understandable configuration**: Easy for humans to read, modify, and maintain
- **Built-in best practices**: Security, authentication, and validation by default
- **Easy deployment path**: From POC to production without vendor lock-in
- **Escape hatch**: Extend with plugins, fork the runtime, or migrate to traditional frameworks

While most projects will remain proofs-of-concept, Zebric ensures they're production-capable and maintainable.
