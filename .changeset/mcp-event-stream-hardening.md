Harden the MCP adapter against a hostile or compromised Zebric application. The event stream now refuses to follow redirects off the discovered origin, times out a stalled connection instead of blocking server startup, validates every server-sent event against a schema before forwarding it, and caps the bytes buffered between SSE record boundaries. Runtime tool responses are size-limited while streaming (rather than after buffering the whole body), and remote-supplied string `pattern` schemas are rejected when they are over-long or nest unbounded quantifiers that risk catastrophic backtracking.
