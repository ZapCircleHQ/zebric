Welcome to the Zebric documentation. This page orients you to the framework's architecture and key concepts.

## Key Concepts

- **Blueprints** are TOML files that declare your data models, pages, access rules, workflows, and notifications. One blueprint defines one application.
- **Runtime Engines** interpret blueprints at run time — no code generation. Changes hot-reload instantly during development.
- **Entities** define your data model (fields, relations, access rules). The runtime auto-creates database tables and REST API endpoints.
- **Pages** bind URL paths to layouts (list, detail, form, dashboard) and queries.
- **Workflows** automate multi-step processes — triggered by entity events, webhooks, or manual actions.
- **Themes** control the look and feel. Built-in themes ship with Tailwind CSS classes.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@zebric/runtime-core` | Rendering, routing, types, and blueprint parsing |
| `@zebric/runtime-node` | Node.js runtime engine (Hono + SQLite/Postgres) |
| `@zebric/runtime-hono` | Hono HTTP adapter |
| `@zebric/runtime-worker` | Cloudflare Workers runtime |
| `@zebric/cli` | `zebric dev` and `zebric validate` commands |
| `@zebric/notifications` | Slack, email, and console notification adapters |
| `@zebric/plugin-sdk` | Plugin development kit |
| `@zebric/themes` | Built-in themes (default, minimal, dashboard) |
| `@zebric/framework-stories` | Integration test stories for example blueprints |

## How It Works

```
blueprint.toml  →  BlueprintParser  →  Runtime Engine  →  HTTP Server
                                            ↓
                                    SQLite / Postgres
```

1. You write a `blueprint.toml` describing your application
2. The `BlueprintParser` validates and parses it into a `Blueprint` object
3. The runtime engine creates database tables, registers routes, and renders pages
4. The HTTP server (Hono) handles requests, enforces access control, and executes workflows

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @zebric/cli
zebric dev --blueprint blueprint.toml --seed
```
