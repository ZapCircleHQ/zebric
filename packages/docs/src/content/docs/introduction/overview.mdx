Welcome to the Zebric documentation. This guide orients new builders to the framework, from blueprints to the runtime engines.

## Key Concepts

- **Blueprints** define data models, pages, behaviors, and workflows.
- **Runtime Engines** render blueprints at run time, no code generation required. Currently supports a Node engine and a Cloudflare Workers engine.
- **Stories** capture real product flows (see the Framework Stories package) and keep the experience bulletproof.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start the dev server for an example: `pnpm --filter blog-example dev`
3. Explore thensample blueprints in `examples/`
