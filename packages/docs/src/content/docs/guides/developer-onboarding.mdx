description: Walk through the onboarding blueprint to understand dashboards, action bars, and workflows.
---

This guide walks through `examples/onboarding/blueprint.toml` — a real blueprint that demonstrates dashboards, detail pages with action bars, forms, and workflows.

## What It Builds

A developer onboarding tool where HR can:
- See a dashboard of new hires and their progress
- View details for each developer with status and assigned tasks
- Advance developers through onboarding stages via action bar buttons
- Create new hire records with a form

## Entities

The blueprint defines four entities:

- **Developer** — the new hire being onboarded (name, email, status, start date)
- **AccessItem** — system access grants (e.g., GitHub, AWS, Slack)
- **OnboardingTask** — checklist items for each new hire
- **RampMilestone** — timeline milestones (30/60/90-day goals)

Each entity uses relations to connect back to the Developer.

## Pages

### Dashboard (`/`)

A dashboard layout with summary queries:

```toml
[page."/"]
title = "Onboarding Dashboard"
auth = "required"
layout = "dashboard"

[page."/".query.newHires]
entity = "Developer"
where = { status = "new" }

[page."/".query.inProgress]
entity = "Developer"
where = { status = "in_progress" }
```

### Developer Detail (`/developers/:id`)

A detail page with an **action bar** that triggers workflows:

```toml
[page."/developers/:id"]
title = "Developer Detail"
auth = "required"
layout = "detail"

[page."/developers/:id".actionBar]
statusField = "status"

[[page."/developers/:id".actionBar.actions]]
label = "Advance Status"
workflow = "AdvanceDeveloperStatus"
style = "primary"
```

The action bar displays the developer's current status and provides buttons to trigger the `AdvanceDeveloperStatus` workflow.

### New Hire Form (`/developers/new`)

A form page for creating new developer records:

```toml
[page."/developers/new"]
title = "Add New Hire"
auth = "required"
layout = "form"

[page."/developers/new".form]
entity = "Developer"
method = "create"

[page."/developers/new".form.onSuccess]
redirect = "/developers/{id}"
```

## Workflows

The `AdvanceDeveloperStatus` workflow is a manual workflow triggered from the action bar. It updates the developer's status field through the onboarding stages.

```toml
[workflow.AdvanceDeveloperStatus]
description = "Move developer to the next onboarding stage."

[workflow.AdvanceDeveloperStatus.trigger]
manual = true
```

## Related Data

The detail page automatically renders related data sections:
- **Access Items** — shown as a checklist
- **Ramp Milestones** — shown as a timeline
- **Onboarding Tasks** — shown as a checklist

The runtime detects the relationship and renders the appropriate component (checklist, timeline, or activity feed) based on the data shape.

## Running the Story Test

Verify the blueprint stays correct:

```bash
pnpm --filter @zebric/framework-stories test -- --grep "developer-onboarding"
```

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

1. **Dashboard + detail + form** page composition
2. **Action bars** with workflow-backed buttons
3. **Related data sections** with smart rendering
4. **Manual workflows** triggered from the UI
5. **Access control** requiring authentication on all pages
