## Why Zebric?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Declarative blueprints" icon="layers">
    Define data models, pages, access rules, workflows, and notifications in a single TOML file. The runtime engine renders it, no code generation at runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runtime-driven" icon="bolt">
    Changes hot-reload instantly during development. No build step, no scaffolding. Works with Node.js/Docker and Cloudflare Workers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in security" icon="check">
    Authentication, role-based access control, CSRF protection, and audit logging are included out of the box.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
