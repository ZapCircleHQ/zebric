description: Overview of why the Zebric framework is different.
---

Zebric is an LLM-native framework for building internal applications without generating tons of code.

Zebric is different because it is **declarative**. 

In a blueprint, you describe:

* What you are building
* The data you want to store
* Who has access to what
* How the system behaves

Zebric's runtime engine handles everything else.

## Why Zebric?

In 2026, vibe coding tools create new applications in minutes - we no longer are limited by the speed of writing code manually. This is fantastic for prototyping, user research, and quick throwaways.

Moving that code into production becomes a lot tougher:

* There's too much code to review, so senior and staff engineers now become a bottleneck
* Generated applications don't always follow a common architecture - you may have Next.js in one application, and React Router in another - both work, but now you've created lots of work down the road to standardize application dependencies
* Teams don't understand the code they ship, they just know that it works
* When the application breaks, no one has an intuitive sense of how data flows within the application.

This leads to a state where pull requests either languish or quickly get approved without real understanding, and technical debt builds up for every application.

## Defining Behavior, Not Code

Zebric takes a different approach. You define how the system works, and the Zebric Runtime Engine enforces that behavior.

Each web application is now a blueprint, or collection of blueprints. These are not tied to specific technical details.

When you use Zebric, you need to think about what the purpose of the application is, who is going to use it, and how it interfaces with external systems - all of that is captured in the blueprint.

The good news - if you ever decide you want to migrate off of Zebric, you can use that blueprint with any LLM to create a whole new application in the web framework of your choice.

## Zebric and LLMs

We've gone down the path of code generation with web application frameworks before - everything from Enterprise JavaBeans to Rails scaffolding - ending up with lots of boilerplate code scattered across multiple service layers.

Using LLMs to create applications just turbocharges this process.

In addition, LLMs will go ahead and add all kinds of things you may or may not want to your projects - even if you try and specify everything up front in the prompt.

Zebric reduces the amount of surface area LLMs have to work with. They have to work within the constraints of Zebric.
