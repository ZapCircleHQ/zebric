description: Define agent-facing APIs with structured actions for AI agents and external tools.
---

Skills define structured, agent-facing APIs in your blueprint. They give AI agents and external tools a typed interface to interact with your application.

## Defining a Skill

```toml
[skill.dispatch]
description = "Create and manage issues in Zebric Dispatch."

[[skill.dispatch.actions]]
name = "create_issue"
description = "Create a new issue."
method = "POST"
path = "/api/issues"
body = { title = "Text", description = "LongText", category = "Enum" }

[[skill.dispatch.actions]]
name = "get_issue"
description = "Fetch an issue by id."
method = "GET"
path = "/api/issues/{id}"

[[skill.dispatch.actions]]
name = "set_status"
description = "Set issue status via workflow."
method = "POST"
path = "/api/issues/{id}/status"
body = { status = "Enum" }
entity = "Issue"
workflow = "SetIssueStatus"

[[skill.dispatch.actions]]
name = "add_comment"
description = "Add a comment to an issue."
method = "POST"
path = "/api/issues/{id}/comments"
body = { body = "LongText", authorType = "Enum" }
entity = "Comment"
action = "create"
[skill.dispatch.actions.mapParams]
id = "issueId"
```

## Action Options

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Action identifier (used by agents to invoke the action) |
| `description` | Human-readable description of what the action does |
| `method` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) |
| `path` | URL path (supports `{id}` placeholders for dynamic segments) |
| `body` | Request body schema — keys are field names, values are types |
| `entity` | Entity to operate on (for CRUD actions) |
| `action` | CRUD action: `create`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `delete` |
| `workflow` | Workflow to trigger when the action is invoked |
| `mapParams` | Map URL path params to entity fields (e.g., `{ id = "issueId" }`) |

## How Skills Work

1. You define skills and actions in your blueprint
2. The runtime registers API routes for each action
3. Agents authenticate via API keys and call the action endpoints
4. Actions execute the specified CRUD operation or trigger the named workflow

## Pairing with API Keys

Skills are typically used with API key authentication:

```toml
[auth]
providers = ["email"]

[[auth.apiKeys]]
name = "dispatch-agent"
keyEnv = "DISPATCH_AGENT_API_KEY"

[skill.dispatch]
description = "Manage dispatch issues."

[[skill.dispatch.actions]]
name = "create_issue"
method = "POST"
path = "/api/issues"
body = { title = "Text" }
```

The agent authenticates with the API key and calls the skill actions:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DISPATCH_AGENT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Server disk full"}'
```

## OpenAPI Integration

Skill actions are included in the auto-generated OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json`, making them discoverable by agents that support OpenAPI tool definitions.
