Blueprints are TOML documents that describe your application. Key sections:

## Entities
Define fields, relations, and access rules. Example:

```toml
[entity.Task]
fields = [
  { name = "id", type = "ULID" },
  { name = "title", type = "Text", required = true }
]
```

## Pages
Bind routes to layouts. Example list page:

```toml
[page."/tasks"]
title = "All Tasks"
layout = "list"
[page."/tasks".query.tasks]
entity = "Task"
```

## Behaviors & Workflows
Use `behavior.render` for custom UI and `workflow.*` for automation. See `examples/onboarding/blueprint.toml` for a full workflow.

## Testing Blueprints
Use `pnpm --filter @zebric/framework-stories test` to ensure your stories stay green.
